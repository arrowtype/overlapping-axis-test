# Overlapping Axis Test

A test of what happens if two axes in a variable font have an overlapping function, as might be the case if Optical Size were controlled by one opsz set to `pt` values and a secondary opsz axis controlled by `px` values.

This font makes use of the letter `a` from [Recursive](https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive) Mono Casual.
